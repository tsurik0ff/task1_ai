1. AI almost fully covered the flow of creating ready-to-go project
2. It took at least half an hour
3. Code was not ready to run, needed to create db manually, create mode didn't work, tests had mistakes, had to make sure all files are in place
4. Testing is always the most challenging in such tasks
5. I already used GPT advices to create projects previously so not so much new was discovered by me
